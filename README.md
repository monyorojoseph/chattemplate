# Chat Templates

Chat templates is a react js app that uses parcel as preset instead of webback. Basically you add a chat and it gets appended.
It doesnt have much features except the basics. You can add more features that suits your needs.
It also uses some bootstrap, am lazy when it comes to css so I relyed on bootstrap.

### Usage
